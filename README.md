**ðŸ‘‹ Hi! I'm [Viktor Bakeev](https://www.linkedin.com/in/viktor-bakeev/), a QA engineer with 4 years of experience.**

Now this profile represents my learning projects created during the [Node.js developer](https://ru.hexlet.io/programs/backend) course I took in 2023-2024 to improve my programming skills. There will be more personalized projects here later.

[The last project](https://github.com/acfohegi/task-manager) helped me practice my skills in:

- setting up CI
- deploying to a cloud platform
- working with database using an ORM
- defining schema in migrations
- separating concerns with the MVC pattern
- integrating with an error monitoring system
- crafting view templates with use of CSS framework
